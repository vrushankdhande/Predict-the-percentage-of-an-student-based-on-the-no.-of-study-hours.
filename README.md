Data Collection: The first step is to collect the data on students' study hours and their corresponding percentages. This data could be collected from surveys, student records, or other sources.

Data Preprocessing: Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to handle any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies. The data may need to be cleaned, normalized, or transformed to ensure accurate and efficient model training.

Data Visualization: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to visualize the relationship between study hours and percentage. This helps to understand any patterns or trends in the data and identify potential outliers.

Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the regression model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

Model Selection: In this project, a simple linear regression model may be used to model the relationship between study hours and percentage. The model will find the best-fit line that represents the linear relationship between the two variables.

Model Training: The linear regression model is trained using the training data. The model adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted percentage and the actual percentage in the training data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using the testing data. Common metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared are used to measure the model's accuracy in predicting the percentage.

Prediction: After the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours they put in.

Visualization of Predictions: The predicted percentage values can be plotted against the study hours to visualize how well the model captures the underlying relationship.

Deployment: The final trained model can be deployed to predict the percentage of a student given the number of study hours they provide as input.
